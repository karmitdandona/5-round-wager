# 5-round-wager
A fun local 2-player game for the Amazon Alexa!

### The Game
* There are 5 rounds and the winner is determined from a best 3 of 5 format.
* Both players start out with 6 coins. Round 1 starts with Player1 wagering any number of their coins (0-6). Player2 then responds with a wager amount.
* Rounds are won by wagering more coins than the other player.
***
* HOWEVER, the loser of a round gets all of their spent coins from that round refunded and the winner must go first in the following round, so wager carefully!
* (If the round is a tie, the starting player of the following round is randomized. This can be an effective strategy to maintain a lead!)

Conceptually, this game is simple to pick up and learn quickly. However, there is a deep mathematical strategy involved in this game, and both players are on fairly similar footing.

#### Future Possibilities to Further this Project
* The game might be more balanced if Player1 starts with 1 coin more than Player2.
* Implement a single player mode to play against Alexa
* Potential to increase number of players (the code scalability is already mostly implemented, but game logic and win conditions would need rebalancing)

##### Note:
This project was created as a learning experience with a heavy emphasis on scalability. Feedback would be greatly appreciated.

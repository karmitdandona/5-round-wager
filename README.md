# 5-round-wager
A fun local 2-player game for the Amazon Alexa!

### The Game
* There are 5 rounds and the winner is determined from a best 3 of 5 format.
* Both players start out with 6 coins. Round 1 starts with Player1 wagering any number of their coins (0-6). Player2 then responds with a wager amount.
* Rounds are won by wagering more coins than the other player.
***
* HOWEVER, the loser of a round gets half of their spent coins from that round refunded and the winner must go first in the following round, so wager carefully!

Conceptually, this game is simple to pick up and learn quickly. However, there is a deep mathematical strategy involved in this game, and both players are on similar footing.

#### Future Possibilities to Further this Project
* Implement a single player mode to play against Alexa
* Potential to increase number of players (the code scalability is already mostly implemented, but game logic and win conditions would need rebalancing)

##### Note:
This project was created as a learning experience with a heavy emphasis on scalability. Feedback would be greatly appreciated.

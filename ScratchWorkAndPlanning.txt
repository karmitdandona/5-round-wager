new idea: after each round, loser gets half of spent coins back, rounded up (winner goes first)

Round1:
  P1: 1
  P2: 2
  P2 wins!    (current balance: P1: 5, P2: 3)

Round2:
  P2: 2
  P1: 1
  P2 wins!    (current balance: P1: 5, P2: 1)

Round3:
  P2: 1
  P1: 2
  P1 wins!    (current balance: P1: 3, P2: 1)


new idea: after each round, each players get 1 coin back and loser gets 1 bonus coin

P1 always starts, but the bonus refund to loser compensates him more
OR::: winner starts next round


P1: 5     P2: 5   refund 1 coin to winner, 2 to loser @ end of round; P1 always goes first

beatable: P2 wins mostly; if winning round, only win by 1 --> if losing, lose by 2 or more




ANSWER:
  best 3of5
  both players start with 6 coins
  loser gets half of spent coins from that round refunded (rounds up)
